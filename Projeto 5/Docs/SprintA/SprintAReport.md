**Sprint Planning:**

* In the first days of sprint A, all user stories and task that were needed to be implemented were created in Jira with the their respective description, assignee, priority, component, label and all the members know the tag to link the commits that were to be done with proper comments to the jira user storie soo its eaier to keep tracking what someone did and what is still missing.
* All the user stories were distributed equaly by the members of the team, although we also helped each other in other tasks so all the teammebers were at the same pace.
* For this Sprint we didn't do daily meetings every day but usualy we always trade messages in whats'app so we all knew what every member was doing.

**Sprint Retrospective:**

* What went well ?
  * In this sprint all the objectives were implemented in the best way we could, due to the continuous work from all elements of the group, and due to a good organization and help between team members;
  * We also manage to distribute the tasks equititaty and everyone help each other to perform their tasks the best way possible.
* What went wrong ?
  * We didn't create any type of test for thelogistics module and integration test between the modules, but all the implementation was done.
  * We didn't manage the time properly, so we did almost everything in the final weeks of the Sprint;
  * There were some mistakes done due to misunderstanding of the requirements of the technologies that should be implemented;
  * The objectives were not that clear to English speaking students due to the lack of English materials.
* What we've learned ?
  * For the next sprints in this units, we hope to do a better job in commits in the first week of the sprints and don't let the tasks pile up, so we have a better organization in the group;
  * Addition of subdivided tasks for every major user story, and the usage of time estimated to complete a task so the team has a better perception of the time every member spent per sprint and a better Burndown chart to present in the end of each sprint.

**Definition of Ready:**

* Is it clear what is to be done?
  * Every member read the project discription and clarified any doubts with the teachers in the classes or in the forum and after the divison of the tasks everyone was ready to start working on their part of the project.
* Do we know all the business rules?
  * Each member double checked with some friends of other groups and teacher to see if we were implementing whats was need the way the client wanted and everyone was casualy checking for updates in emails teachers sent to see if anything was changed in the business rules.
* Do we have a test plan and test cases?
  * Each user story is going to have a proper test plan and test cases, just like we learnt in arqsi theorical-pratical classes using collections in Postman.

**Definition of Done:**

* Can we close this issue?
  * Analisys and design were done and the code was commited with a proper message for each user story and task.
  * Unit test were developed and are passing, and funcional tests were performed and recorded for each user story and task bellow.
  * After all this points were implemented and verified we can close the issue in Jira.
