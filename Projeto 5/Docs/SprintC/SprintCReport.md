![](blob:file:///9627d78b-35a5-42d9-860e-f64deddccc66)**Sprint Planning:**

* In the first days of sprint C, all user stories and task that were needed to be implemented were created in Jira with the their respective description, assignee, priority, component, label and subtasks were also created and used to divide the user story in more small tasks(ex: analisys, diagrams, implementation, testing and report).
* All members did smart commits, so when a commit is created there is always a link to an issue in Jira and with a proper, but simple message about the work commited.
* All the user stories were distributed equaly by the members of the team, although we can also help each other in other tasks so all the teammembers have no problems going forward in sprint.
* In Sprint B we did daily meetings every day but we didnt registered it in Jira, but usualy we always trade daily messages in whats'app so we all know what every member is doing. So for Sprint C we will continuing trading message between all members daily.

**Sprint Retrospective:**

* What went well ?
  * In this sprint all the objectives were implemented in the best way we could, due to the continuous work from all elements of the group, and due to a good organization and help between team members;
  * We manage to connect all modules in the cloud without errors and even created automatic tests and deployment that run with the pipelines;
  * We also manage to distribute the tasks equaly and everyone help each other to perform their tasks the best way possible;
  * We Added subdivided tasks for every major user story and other issues so we could divide the work in small and simpler tasks, so commits would be more easier to understand.
  * We managed to have documentation in all modules.
* What went wrong ?
  * We didn't manage the time properly, so we did a biggest part of the project in the final  two weeks of this Sprint because of holidays break;
  * There were maybe some mistakes done due to misunderstanding of the requirements of the technologies that should be implemented;
* What we've learned ?
  * We learn a lot of new technologies(e.g CI/CD, azure cloud, writing different type of tests).
  * We learn how to do a proper planning before each sprint, how to divide the tasks and how to work in a team enviroment.
  * We also learn a lot about the data protection protocols and how to use/apply them.
* Actions to improve in the future?
  * Better connection between SPA and 3D vizualization of the trips of the trucks.
  * Test all the possible scenarios since we have most of them covered.
  * Writing a better documentation for each module.

**Definition of Ready:**

* Is it clear what is to be done?
  * Every member read the project discription and clarified any doubts with the teachers in the classes or in the forum and after the divison of the tasks everyone was ready to start working on their part of the project.
* Do we know all the business rules?
  * Each member double checked with some friends of other groups and teacher to see if we were implementing whats was need the way the client wanted and everyone was casualy checking for updates in emails teachers sent to see if anything was changed in the business rules.
* Do we have a test plan and test cases?
  * Each user story for aqrsi for SPA module is going to have a proper test plan and test cases, just like we learnt in arqsi theorical-pratical classes using collections in Postman.

**Definition of Done:**

* Can we close this issue?
  * Analisys and design were done and the code was commited with a proper message for each user story and task.
  * Unit test were developed and are passing, and funcional tests were performed and recorded for each user story and task bellow.
  * After all this points were implemented and verified we can close the issue in Jira.

**Demonstration**

* We prepared different pipelines for build and tests, which are run from master branch and for deployment which are run from deploy branch.
* deployment pipelines push the planning, logistics,warehouse and SPA modules into azure app service.
